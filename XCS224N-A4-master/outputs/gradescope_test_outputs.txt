So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or your own self, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of us and in fact for the making of financial decisions, and in fact for financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from the one that would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, your brain injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most popular drugs in the world today, even it's likely to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or whether you have a surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of <unk> <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not whether it's a doctor, and if it's somebody's fault.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the <unk> more widely <unk> which believe it is?
How many people have to take it before they help one person?
300.
This according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the medication for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke or other event <unk>
Now you might think, "Well, a probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the effects <unk> Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> pain -- but now they are thinking, "The Five is not very likely to happen to me, still the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think very clearly.
So think about how to do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the spot.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to come out of the drug to help your medicine.
I don't mean you should not take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
Latin medical ethic is a part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is actually done in the older men in the 1950s, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
So 49 surgeries for a person who has helped have helped it.
And the side effects in that case, are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make it <unk> the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this in the spot.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, they want a <unk> life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that point is that you shut up a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
You face a face with a <unk> you don't need the system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. Could you get to be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought -- like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize the harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate of input in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of cards I didn't have <unk> and lots of messages I haven't read.
So I'm not quite organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two hundred.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree -- there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can I never get to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of <unk> the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French language language came over the decade of 1800, and over the course of time, we mixed with local signs, and they developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country following injection their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound of you?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like <unk> and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise in the eating of <unk> <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating sure they're not <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, about the one who's going to come next.
From there this drawing.
<unk> for decide.
<unk> for moving on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> subtle and <unk>
In the culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to make my thumb like this, it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that struck me the <unk>
There was no visual art, all of it was <unk>
Now sound has come into my field of art.
It's going to be more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that we don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the number of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency <unk>
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could <unk>
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support the same as and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> your voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If I won't continue with this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said to a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning both of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in a lot of different <unk>
If you map a <unk> different <unk> as the piano, like facial expression, the movement, the body of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand, the speed, the way the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if it was <unk> just one key at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in the way to express an obvious concept or idea in <unk>
If only one key would change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the music?
If I had to create a sign and get it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is completely <unk>
If you pull it up, and we <unk> the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to me tonight."
<unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the tonight."
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So, the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, and dramatic and dramatic idea, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk> in <unk> same time."
Watch <unk> right hand -- <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do that with me?
All of your hands.
Now we're going to do it as much in your head like chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look how the three signs are very similar. Everyone goes on the head and the chest but they are transmitted very different meanings into the head.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy to the same as music.
However, today, we live in a very dramatic world.
And just because <unk> doesn't have it automatically -- it doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And perhaps people will understand that there is not to be deaf to learn <unk> not that you have to hear music to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove and I'd like to have the same experience.
I'd like to start to open your ears, open your ears, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can do it all, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> is responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence of innocence or a bubble of ignorance should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning up others.
The country, now I'm a adult and I teach citizen and invention in the Indian school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait long for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but now more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we connect these plastic pieces to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also too risky to use these huge <unk>
So along with my students, with six to 15, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that the children very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you the children who are providing electric tools and feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
So we do.
I leave you to my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure them into something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children are getting a lot with the robots.
And then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast at creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned to light lights, and we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see plastic pieces and slowly through the sensor while the computer on board would process this image, and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I can investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water you drink, it's the water that you put into the water where the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown the mud and the oil also are brown color and when everything <unk> is very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
So we built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help you identify what's in the water.
<unk> this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I can investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to tackle a more difficult problem, and also close to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half a French and perhaps remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that started various giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> took several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power plant.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the <unk> coast -- and the majority, at the moment, has safe -- it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident, and research in an independent way, with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night I went into the center of <unk> here you see the use of different <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Along with them we discuss the data -- that day, and we talked about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the <unk> <unk> map to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to see that the radioactive dust will be <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We get up to a mile of the nuclear station, and with the fishermen help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> of sediment as we invented and we've built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve problems.
I wonder if we should make the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became so much small, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space and environmental and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and this is a place where we can work with metal wood, chemistry, a little bit of optical optics -- basically, you can build almost entirely there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help the mobility of the age of the age of age transforming their standard <unk> in new self-driving cars.
plastic and oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children with the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientific citizens, creators, <unk> we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about environment and people, and so that I can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes -- <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made of thousands of steel parts, the other one of a silk dragline
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One gets place on the environment, the other thing I thought of.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Miguel <unk> said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Miguel <unk>
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we carry all of the information that they needed by every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have been <unk> a world made out of place, and they were <unk> the imagination of designers and architects architects to think of their objects as <unk> of parts of different functions.
But you don't find any <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with pores <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts as a filter mainly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that varies gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- the <unk> <unk> of every designer and an architect to work between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere, and the law, analytics and synthesis, is shown in both screens after me.
My work, at the simplest level, trying to bring these two visions of the world, heading out of the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourself, Why now?
Why was it not possible this is about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, products, and tools and tools through scale of the size of 24 meters in the diameter of a <unk> basis, that one day not very far to print buildings <unk> and graphics in the nanoscale made of genetically altered <unk> that glow in the dark.
So here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of ancient architecture, and has created a screen where every opening is a unique size to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion tour of Paris with <unk> van <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing collaborator, we print this layer and <unk> <unk> between cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a functional scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution to this high resolution and <unk> instruments that allows us to design products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a comfortable chair, and also it absorbs sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator came back to nature, and to design this pattern of surface surface -- becomes <unk>
And we put this from 44 different properties of different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like nature, varies its functionality not by addition to the addition of other material or other <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk>
But it's the <unk> nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I didn't raised myself in a religious Jew but when I was a young man, my grandmother would tell me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came up and came to define a lot of what I care about.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends on the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there was no difference between trunk, branches, <unk> and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land would grow trees with branches, <unk> and <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of place.
I often ask myself, "What would the design look like if the objects were made by a <unk>
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the material to look at the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year by organisms as shrimp, or <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a lot of chicken husks the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures in scale, this is a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the way and create these structures made from a single material 3.5 feet long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are lists, it leaves dry it to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the <unk> process were used to contain <unk> <unk> which first appeared on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed to capture rapidly in the atmosphere and make it <unk>
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition with no problems of <unk> <unk> and if it broadens even more to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little synthetic biology, and we've transformed a little bit of synthetic biology, in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed to be done in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, they will grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration of the same exploration of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> <unk> we made our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology, like liquid <unk> just instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We were using our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothing -- two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and the ponds of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One becomes sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
To hold these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the nasal tract that will help you flow out these bacteria and to make their function of path.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the functionality of <unk>
So if we wanted more <unk> we had more transparent channels.
This digestive system <unk> when it stretches out of one end to another, is 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our little thin.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels and bright channels in their clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are creatures in the fashion -- only half is <unk>
What if the design is <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin <unk> the <unk> tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of editing the biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer <unk> material.
You also know that nature doesn't do it.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly <unk> architecture in which it was <unk>
The manufacturing is not <unk> about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the <unk> put those fibers to each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces in life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a flat, and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've found that the way, the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly through the environment.
It often was <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk would be <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can form a form of <unk> silk without boiling one <unk>
They were <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot making silk, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that the silk worms were going into the most dark and <unk> areas that we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat heat -- distributed silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> silk worms to a online farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and while they were <unk> <unk> they <unk> they get eggs, and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
So Al biological silk on <unk> silk is giving all this pavilion their integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms -- <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the road <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to products and the buildings around us, to form a different ecology of two materials -- designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature in nature, inspired from us, for the first time that we make ourselves charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you ever asked, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can get them with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked English -- the <unk> and the art and started websites, and I started to play the guitar in a crazy band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it gets to <unk>
And I have to let it up.
But then I'm going to get it to something else, something totally different, and I'm going to focus on it, and I'm going to absorb myself -- and I feel <unk> I've found it and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions, and they would give them to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more <unk>
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad at me because of nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have a little bit <unk>
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where it was -- they learned about culture.
Do you ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
We have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would expect, at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in kids like, to be <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is done over and again as you grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students asking them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise, before we take away the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by the children to dream with what they might be, don't inspire dream to dream with everything that they might be.
In fact, it's just doing the opposite, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 things, but <unk> <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> professor and creative.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they will have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or real calling the idea that each of us has something to do during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there is a lot of different themes that are looking at their curiosity and lots of different things that wants to do?
There is no place for somebody in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if you divide it into three parts: and you get potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that would be <unk> the same idea, as <unk> <unk>
In the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or <unk> you must win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there's huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, and design, math and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this single idea by his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
From there coming up with new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second superpower <unk> is very fast learning.
When we were <unk> we are <unk> we are going to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to succeed, and we've been a lot of times in the past, and this means we have less fear of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of abilities are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to each new area that we have, so rarely started from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a complete <unk> and an independent woman.
As a girl pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop the memory memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become a writer <unk> it was a lot of financial school.
He had to learn the most fine sales of sales when they started their practices, and this ability helps it to write a compelling parent for editors.
They rarely have a loss of time to get to what you could even do if at the end of the <unk>
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. It is, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes a director of videos, no other designer designer designer designer designer, sometimes a teacher, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's worth a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different roles depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> magazine Company defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quick learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that might lose if they're pushed to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster people's <unk>
We have complex problems -- <unk> right now, and we need no creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> can dive deep and put in practice ideas, and <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and racing lives that are connected to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> most of them are being told to be more like their fellow <unk>
And once I said that, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart heart, then you go through the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes, I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
Would you hear the intersections.
<unk> our inner <unk> takes us to a more authentic life and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> to a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric psychiatric facility.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but it was <unk> for it until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy that had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If you had been alive today, it would have been living today, we couldn't give it to her more aid than <unk> gave him <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have been discovered, antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has made progress in Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists that work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live to the age of 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability that you pass their years or Alzheimer's disease or helping care of a friend or be dear to Alzheimer's disease.
Just in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spending in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- a rise of five times in 2050, as the generation of the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the largest medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively unusual to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death across the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've spent less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's of the fact that in spite of the fact that the disease costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but everyone <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of all, even scientists, scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in an inevitable and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain, compared to a patient patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to creating severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found tectonic and <unk> <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century.
For nearly a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds out as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out well, these dots -- end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are going on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we did, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of them have been reduced the wires and waited for the better.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that are blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
So let's look at a few videos of what happened when these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that they stick in each of them, like in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that they <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive results, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and fix.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to get that hope, from overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to figure out that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we did, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry on scientists and <unk>
That was essential to advance the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden, caregivers for their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So, really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
It was this article in the New York column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To love someone, do this.
The paper is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when it was one night of the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 more personal questions, and then you both look at the eyes without talking about four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here.
Number three: If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you go to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal ones.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to do, or it was very honest with this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I encountered this study in this study a few years ago, a really struck me the attention that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
But we had <unk> and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the street in the way, a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask, keep still still still there?
And the reason I think is <unk> this is because they've done this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before I woke up the paper I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book over the last few years, so I had encouraged me to write about my experience of romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entry can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my paper in the New York Times would be probably a few thousand views.
And that took a good burden of attention to a relatively new relationship.
But as he did, I had no idea.
The article published on a Friday night, and on Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And Sunday, I had been called <unk> Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper was got over eight million <unk> and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing about their own stressful experiences, but another thing is to find that loving life of one has been international news --  -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, all the same question: Are they still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email in my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were students and journalists and <unk> of strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk -- and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey, <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put in red.
So I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable by asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article called San <unk> who included the experience of readers to testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to each request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and he refused the orders of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons in the icons in the process of <unk> a range for which I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, and they wanted to know whether to really do it, or do it -- if it was able to produce love <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, mostly that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if they were <unk> or not, and then <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first of these questions in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
And instead of that, I was looking at <unk> <unk> among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds crazy, right?
But the study worked.
The participants were felt closer after doing -- several more studies, they were also used <unk> <unk> <unk> as a rapid way to create trust and interaction among strangers.
They've used it between the police and the community and the community of the community, and they've used it between people from <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tested last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was actually cited in this piece, but unfortunately it was never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little <unk> university, and then a student came up to me and he told me with <unk> I tried the study and didn't work.
He looked like it was <unk> by it.
And I said, "You want to say, you want to tell you that you would give you the person who is <unk>
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but it became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better better after testing the research lab.
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and was going through a really hard one.
I had this relationship since I had 20, which I was supposed to almost all my adult life, and he was my first true love -- and he had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I was focusing on science.
And I was able to find everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that to be a kind of <unk> <unk>
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just found out for the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to get back then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one or a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I mean.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is times more than reasonably reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for is a <unk> not just about being <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I will continue to be <unk> by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were wondering when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some way to mitigate some risk of risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of the story.
So the story of the story is, still follow together?
And your content with an answer or No.
So more than a question would propose that we do more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who is deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love with me when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think it's a good start to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So, if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's a year ago, a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, and we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing that remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I had not considered everything that choice was supposed to be.
I didn't consider how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep making that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, have chosen to love someone as generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship to the kind of myth where I don't think really.
And what I think about, and what maybe spending my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I did not know.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love somebody, and the hope that he would also love, and it's scary -- but that's a deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian in broad mountain and in a way, in a way, as a forest <unk>
New York City ago a time ago,  -- something that affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
So I took a box of wood, and you put a ticket from a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our sort of <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's kind of grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a time I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and <unk> and all of those things -- and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> in the style Agnes Martin, the covered of resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid to bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin in the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite of the opposite: in some way it seemed to make it <unk> as if it was going to make the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
And this time, I began to add elements of electronic elements, and they were strange bottles that I could find out on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow up with just drawing the same as a body of the <unk>
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started to mount exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was cool, man.
At some point I became interested in the human way, sculptures of <unk> <unk> of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was going to get it.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing on a window, and then another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that were a three-dimensional composition there.
And this would actually work, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work is <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It's got double faces, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, there is Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all these creatures have been moving in between two worlds.
They are from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with heads of animals are run by the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a <unk> god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a mythological <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then when you go to the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a tail of 5.5 feet long, a tail tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on fire on a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in a ocular ocular balloon.
They have been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from the terrorists.
All of your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a file of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a human way of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together.
And you can walk between them. He's getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest you can get the <unk>
I'm going to see them for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of your chest, and that it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has -- a kind of thing that's <unk>
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't get it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body party for half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and enter the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest in the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes in which we live.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Inside this box is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a fellow <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
We <unk> the box and all the people in it appear to each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you're <unk> who is and the box that it's living on.
And together we got to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of countries, from borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very facts from the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with ironic and <unk> we're going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your mind?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug will be made in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are being able to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the blood <unk>
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in their most negative, because in the time that it takes to the <unk> <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes it to your head, which is where it's more important, in the HIV warehouse
These are regions of the body like the swollen side, the nervous system -- the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily come into the blood flow of patients that are <unk> to regular drug drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a treatment for life that is oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> will make the treatment directly into the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for health care, and surgery surgery can be used for anything else -- including the transport of drug drugs.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open or <unk> extremely small holes, which opens and closed -- almost immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best you ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of laser beam on the cellular membrane on the cellular membrane in HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of <unk>
Before I even realized, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or tectonic plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it runs to the location of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the <unk> dream of <unk> in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups, not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups are doing when they're not shoot 'n.
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence from violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to violent <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to these groups to solve almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, the <unk> peacekeeping deals between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any conflict process, successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
So we know very well the reasons why they do, but no one analyzes what they do when you don't get to.
The armed struggle and political struggle are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
Local groups are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> met by their violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also set up a political game, a social services and a military system.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
It's multitasking
<unk> a complex machinery of radio stations TV channels TV channels and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
Local groups are also investing in a complex fundraising.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase your funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
Local groups are also doing something else else -- create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they get professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
Local groups are also trying to conquer the population to offering something that the state is not safe, security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn by the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> <unk> can also be understood by the efforts of these groups for given.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher price.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by government, and lets these groups strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 in 2006 cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we looked at the <unk> groups we only think on the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrids.
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by government, and emerge as armed groups, political groups, engage in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated are all these organizations, fewer we can be <unk> as opposed to a state.
How is a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run all of their <unk> they collect the trash, you run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines <unk>
We live in a world of states, <unk> nations and hybrids and the more weak the states, as in the Middle East, more inclusive, and fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups you need to invest more in military tools.
<unk> that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and strengthen the peace.
If we understand the best groups that will better understand what incentives to provide the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors not enterprises, the military power can win some <unk> but we won't give peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety gap to fill out that vacuum of government that allowed these groups thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label of <unk> would be unfair for the <unk>
I am <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I get excited about as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had some strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and hated sex. As if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and the anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> that might be a feminist.
Being labeled as feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty <unk>
I think about it as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who calls too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or higher to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel through the world as much as free or violence or violence.
We have right to use very easy to use the contraceptives and affordable services and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies without <unk> controls, or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We're people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition, skills and much more.
We need to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When you're driving work, I hear rap music -- all volume.
Even though the letter degrades the women and it's deeply, deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin yang of yin yang is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely <unk> by my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> but also killing insects -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> bedtime stories that they come true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's your choice, and I'm not who to be aware of it.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I agreed that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to the same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women be economically vulnerable when they were born.
Let's have this problem.
It was <unk> conventional feminism has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, the workers, gay workers, and <unk> in favor of white, <unk> middle-class
<unk> if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist person.
It also happens to this: <unk> <unk>
We have this tendency to put psychologists on a <unk>
We hope to make it seamlessly.
When we get to take them out with a lot of taste of the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I was a <unk> before you try to get there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> by fear of what it means for fear and fear not to be able to fulfill the cheap expectations <unk>
Let's take for example, or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk>
It was a <unk> show to this pop star embracing openly feminism and to make women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started endless arguments if <unk> was or not exactly feminist.
They put up their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much so <unk>
We're going much beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until it wasn't nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> <unk> or more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give it to the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing a limitless.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change effectively to their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does your music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify this, it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
They are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> I want to grow in a world.
It's where they were excited by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice will be used as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sports -- <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies don't deal with women as well as objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their fellow as <unk> sacks as <unk>
In any case men, men, especially heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish them in his project, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of other women, so much to participate in how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be able to participate in this kind of projects, we can also engage them to be including more like us as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision decisions.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> without having these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, people in the power of directors and cinema and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting and significant change.
We can also claim with courage our feminism, -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true for many reasons, but I say, above all, because ancient my voice was stolen to me and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A few guys were telling me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I don't think I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was blown away in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have brown skin.
I read the words of women that showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, too, I discovered that if I was a little brave one, another woman would be able to go and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is about to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue the cool reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need such a courage.
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because of being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily known diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half the century -- but many of the children involved in the Islamic outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud by British Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know that, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
So here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> who had heard about her create a whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates kept stable only three or four children for every 10.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> fundraising transfers as <unk> <unk> they refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could get rid of another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people at the U.K. Control Center question what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to explain these numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of his son of two years, the eye contact with visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to <unk> why they were so <unk> in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is that what happened is less than to see with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist <unk> Leo at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey from panic to <unk> as when they don't put your favorite toy in their usual location without knowing them.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the decade of 1950, as the main authority in the world in the subject, I recognized that I had seen less than 150 real cases of their syndrome while we were making it references from places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria for autism diagnosis, they were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that the epilepsy, is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine out of 10 children sent by other doctors to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child disease, caused by cold, cold and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have kept very carefully in a refrigerator that you don't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I was two years old.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents would be desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic kids were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> scientific psychologist in London, thought the theory of <unk> mothers in <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband was John <unk> and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like <unk> without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand up to the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
<unk> a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find people in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was a lot more <unk> and diverse reality.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the genealogy of <unk>
In the other way, these children didn't fit in nice boxes and <unk> as he said, <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try and make sense of the data.
How no one had been <unk> from these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in <unk> the next year of <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided her <unk> in his own work.
There was not even one translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic integrated with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with kinds of exercises with music, and the children were following their games on the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a disabled disability, of life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating the children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and he took them to help the development of education that were especially suited to them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse diverse than any amazing variety of friends and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in events known in the pop-up culture as the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as the parents were <unk>
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic for the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes arrived in <unk> by the <unk> model of <unk> by a broad and <unk> <unk>
These changes didn't fall out in <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked on <unk> to reshape these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out, <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards from <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and fathers all over the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection to that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect <unk> of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> they were hoping that it were, they actually hoped that this was, getting people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the increase in diagnostics. A simple, powerful story -- so bad history as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children are on the spectrum, people are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
Over the last few years, people have come together on the Internet to reject the idea that these are the puzzles to solve for the new breakthroughs -- doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> <unk> human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
<unk> people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most autism aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers are in the understanding of teachers, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands in deck to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we went into an uncertain future, we need all the human intelligence forms on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to afford a brain.
Thank you.
